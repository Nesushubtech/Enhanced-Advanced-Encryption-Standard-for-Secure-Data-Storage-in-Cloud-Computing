Title: Developing an Enhanced Advanced Encryption Standard for Secure Data Storage in Cloud Computing</p>

<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p>Cloud computing has significantly transformed the way data is stored and accessed. This innovation has brought about critical security concerns such as confidentiality, integrity, and access control. To address these security challenges, associated with the wide acceptability of cloud computing by organizations, several efforts have sought to develop effective strategies for safeguarding sensitive data in an increasingly digital world. The current study proposes a framework that integrates Advanced Encryption Standard with One-Time Password (AES-OTP) and also optimizes performance. The study aims to simulate and validate this framework's effectiveness in cloud environments.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION</h2>
<h3>1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY</h3>
<p>The advent of cloud computing has fundamentally transformed the landscape of data storage and management, offering organizations unprecedented scalability, flexibility, and cost-effectiveness. By leveraging cloud services, businesses can access vast amounts of computing resources and storage capabilities without the need for significant upfront investments in physical infrastructure. The flexibility of cloud solutions has become increasingly vital as organizations navigate the complexities of digital transformation and the growing demand for remote work capabilities, enabling them to maintain operational continuity and enhance productivity (Sayegh, 2024). This shift allows organizations to scale their operations dynamically, responding to fluctuating demands with ease (Admassu, 2024).</p>

<p>The transition to cloud-based solutions has not come without its challenges. As organizations increasingly rely on cloud services to store sensitive data, they face significant security concerns, particularly regarding the protection of private information stored on remote servers. The decentralized nature of cloud computing introduces vulnerabilities that can be exploited by malicious actors, leading to data breaches, unauthorized access, and potential loss of sensitive information. According to a report by the Cloud Security Alliance (2020), data breaches remain one of the top concerns for organizations utilizing cloud services, with incidents often resulting in severe financial and reputational damage.</p>

<p>The security challenges associated with cloud computing are multifaceted and continue to evolve as organizations increasingly adopt cloud services. The shared infrastructure model of cloud services means that multiple tenants may store their data on the same physical servers, raising significant concerns about data isolation and the risk of cross-tenant data exposure (Kumar et al., 2023). Additionally, the lack of physical control over data stored in the cloud complicates compliance with data protection regulations, such as the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) (Almorsy et al., 2023). Furthermore, traditional security measures may not adequately address the unique threats posed by cloud environments, such as misconfigurations and insecure APIs, necessitating the development of advanced security mechanisms and continuous monitoring to safeguard sensitive information (Aqua Security, 2024).</p>

<p>This study proposes an enhanced Advanced Encryption Standard data security in cloud computing environments. The framework integrates the Advanced Encryption Standard with One-Time Password (AES-OTP), providing a robust solution that combines the strengths of both symmetric methods. AES-OTP offers efficient encryption for large volumes of data, while facilitating secure key exchange and authentication, ensuring that sensitive information remains protected during transmission and storage (Shivaramakrishna & Nagaratna, 2023).</p>

<h3>PROBLEM STATEMENT</h3>
<p>Despite advancements in cloud security, existing encryption and access control mechanisms often fall short in providing comprehensive protection against evolving cyber threats. Traditional methods may not adequately address the complexities of securing sensitive data in cloud environments, leading to potential vulnerabilities and increased risks of unauthorized access. The primary challenge lies in designing a secure data storage system that effectively balances strong security measures with user accessibility while ensuring compliance with various data protection regulations. This study proposes an enhanced Advanced Encryption Standard method with One-Time Password.</p>

<h3>1.3 MOTIVATION</h3>
<p>The motivation behind this study stems from the urgent need to enhance data security in cloud computing. As organizations increasingly adopt cloud services, the potential for data breaches and unauthorized access poses a significant risk to the confidentiality and integrity of sensitive data.</p>
